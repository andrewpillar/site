2019 is around the corner, and it has been 2 months since the
[first post](/programming/2018/10/07/introducing-jrnl) I made on this blog,
though I doubt anyone is actively following/reading. I have done very little to
advertise it so what should I expect? However I think now is an apt time to
justify the purpose of this blog, and layout some of the things I would like to
achieve in the coming year.

So, the purpose of this blog. Primarily, it will serve me, and as a bi-product
of that, hopefully others. Starting out, I expect to write about the tools I'm
using, the software I'm building, and have these posts act as references that I
can look back on to aid in my learning. When learning something new, I find it
best to write out my understanding. Hopefully if anyone does stumble upon my
writings, I would like for them to be of use. I should also expect this blog to
serve as a factor of motivation, whereby I can write about what I am doing, and
how I am progressing. This blog could serve as my own personal digital rubber
duck, if you will. And finally, I would like to hopefully improve my writing
ability, which leads me into what I hope to achieve this year...

Recently, I've picked up Go in the my free time. I like it as a language, and
absolutely adore the simplicity of its build system, whereby most projects are
either a `go build`, or `go install` away from running. The only thing of
substance I've build with Go is [jrnl](https://github.com/andrewpillar/jrnl),
and a small library called [cli](https://github.com/andrewpillar/cli) for
quickly building multi-command CLI applications in Go. Though now that I come
to think of it I'd be cautious when it comes to using the words "of substance"
to describe either of these projects. In the coming year I would like to further
my ability, and perhaps the best way of doing is by building things,
specifically things I intend to use.

One idea I've had for a project is a migration tool for running migrations
against SQL databases easily. I have yet to find one which satisfies my needs,
whereby I feed it a bunch of SQL scripts to arbitrarily run, if they haven't
been run already. Most I've come across seem too tied to a pre-existing ORM,
such as Alembic for example, or the migrations tools that come bundled with
Laravel. Both very powerful, though not versatile in my opinion. I haven't
written any code for this yet, but in my mind I'd expect to be simple, you run
the migrations, and you roll them back. Each time to run the migrations, it will
only run the scripts that haven't been run before.

There is also some work I still need to do on
[jrnl](https://github.com/andrewpillar/jrnl), primarily add support for RSS feed
generation, other than that I'd say it's feature complete, unless there's any
bugs lurking around in the code.

I also intend on expanding my repertoire when it comes to what I read. I'm a
sucker for your typical fantasy setting, whether it be your classic sword, and
sorcery, or a more politically charged fantasy thriller. My reading list
currently sits at about 5 books, The Lady of the Lake, The Handmaid's Tale, and
the Dune trilogy. Currently I'm halfway through The Tower of the Swallow, and
will pick up Dune once I've finished reading the Lady of the Lake. Perhaps I
will also use this blog as a dumping ground on my thoughts regarding the books
I read, and the movies I see too, we shall see.
